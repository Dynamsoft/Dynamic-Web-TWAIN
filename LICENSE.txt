BEFORE CONTINUING WITH THE INSTALLATION OF THE SOFTWARE, YOU MUST READ, ACKNOWLEDGE AND ACCEPT THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT THAT FOLLOWS ("AGREEMENT"). IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE AGREEMENT, YOU MAY, WITHIN THIRTY (30) DAYS OF PURCHASE RETURN THE SOFTWARE TO THE PLACE YOU OBTAINED IT FOR A FULL REFUND.
1. DEFINITIONS
"Application" means an end user program that the Licensee develops using the Software and into which the Redistributables are incorporated, and which contain significant additional functionality over and above the functionality contained in the Software. Read what is counted as a single application to learn more.
"Licensee" means the person or entity entering into this Agreement with Dynamsoft. Any person who is entering into this Agreement on behalf of an organizational entity represents that he or she has the authority to bind such entity.
"Redistributables" are those runtime libraries and files intended for duplication and distribution with the Application.
"Server" means a device or computer that has the Software loaded into its RAM. Server includes the following: (i) a networked device with the Software installed that's accessible by multiple users who can independently operate the Software from another machine, (ii) a networked device with the Software running as a service that accepts connections from other machines or applications, (iii) a computer with the Software running to service the public or multiple users, e.g. a kiosk or a scan station, and (iv) a web server with the Software deployed that accepts end user connection to run the Software on the client machines.
"Software": The "Dynamic Web TWAIN" software and its add-ons, accompanying components, parts and documentation that have been developed by Dynamsoft. If you are using Dynamic Web TWAIN along with Dynamsoft OCR Professional add-on, the Dynamsoft OCR Professional EULA will apply at the same time. 
2.GRANT OF LICENSE 
Dynamsoft Corporation grants you a nonexclusive, non-transferable, and limited license to use the Software products and functionalities for which you have paid the applicable fees solely for your internal business purposes and in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. The Software is licensed, not sold, to you. If you acquire or are provided with any directories, components, connectors, utilities, data, or other items from Dynamsoft for use with the Software (the "Additional Software"), your use of the Additional Software shall be in accordance with the terms, conditions, obligations and restrictions of this Agreement. The term "Software" as used herein, shall be deemed to include the Additional Software and Third Party Products.
2.1 Installation and Use
You may install and use the Software only in the configuration and for the number of licenses acquired by you. In order to exercise your rights to the Software under this License Agreement you must activate your copy of the Software in the manner described during the launch sequence. Dynamsoft may control the number and type of licenses and the use of the Software by keycode(s).
2.2 Evaluation License
An Evaluation License may be used only for the number and type of licenses specified and for the period specified on the Software packaging, ordering or shipping documentation. Upon expiration of such specified period, the Software associated with an Evaluation License will cease to function unless Licensee has purchased full license keys. If the ordering or shipping documentation specifies a particular project, the Software may be used only with that project.  
An Evaluation License may only be used for evaluation or testing purposes and may not be used for production purposes. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Software provided under an Evaluation License is provided "AS-IS" without warranty of any kind, express or implied. An Evaluation License may be terminated by Dynamsoft Corporation upon written notice at any time.
2.3 Deployment License	
A Deployment License allows copying, deployment, and distribution of the Redistributables to end users, without further distribution, as part of the Application for your internal business purposes, not for resale to external customers. 
Unless otherwise stated in a duly executed agreement, annual subscription licenses will be valid for one year beginning with the license activation date. Licensee can extend licenses for additional one-year periods (each a "Renewal Term").
The Deployment Licenses is on a per Application basis with the following licensing options available:
•	Per Browser Client
One Browser Client License allows access to a same-origin Application (same protocol, same host, and same port) to use the functionalities provided by the Software from one unique browser client. 
A Browser Client that has not accessed any functionality of the Software for consecutive 90 days is considered an inactive browser client. The license seat taken by an inactive browser client will be automatically released and available for use by any other active browser client.
When you reach the limit of the granted number of license seats, Dynamsoft offers a free additional 10% of your browser client allowance for your emergency use. Once running out of the additional browser client allowance, no new browser clients can access and use the Software until there are available license seats again. Please note that running out of your browser client allowance wouldn't impact any browser client that has already been licensed.
•	Per Server License
One Server License is required to deploy the Application to one Server. Servers apply to both physical and virtual servers and include but are not limited to production servers all of which require licensing: failover servers, development servers that are also used for testing purposes, quality assurance servers, testing servers, and staging servers. Continuous integration servers (build servers) and localhost development servers don't require additional licenses. 
If the Application is deployed to cloud platforms, each cloud instance or container that the Application runs on is counted as one Server.
Once a Server License has been purchased, there is no limit on the number of client browsers that access the Application and no limit on the number of document pages to be scanned or processed by the Software. 
•	Per Page
With a Per Page License, the Software can be used for processing a given number of document pages. For example, with a license for 100K pages of the scanner module of the Software, you can scan up to 100K document pages and save them to your server. 
Please contact sales@dynamsoft.com if you are interested in the Per Page License option.
2.4 OEM and other Deployment Licenses 
Licensee must execute a separate License Agreement prior to making any commercial deployment of the Application to third-party end users, either directly or through distribution channels. This may happen when Licensee acts as an ISV, OEM, or solution provider offering the Application to the public.
Additional licensing options can be discussed with sales@dynamsoft.com.
3.EFFECT OF TERMINATION
Upon the expiration of subscription licenses, all rights granted to the Licensee under this Agreement (including but not limited to, the rights to use, and/or provide access to the Software) shall terminate unless renewed, and Licensee shall immediately: (a) cease incorporating the Software into the Application; (b) cease use of the Software (in any form, including partial copies in its possession or under its control), and (c) destroy and decommission all copies of the Software.
4.RESTRICTIONS

Your product is targeted to end users. The end-user application you develop using the Software must not be another development tool and/or SDK.
Users of end-user applications you develop using the Software may not further use the Software, in whole or in part, for software development, copying or distribution. You must enforce this restriction in a separate agreement between you and the end user of your applications.
Evaluation License holders are granted the use of only one copy of the Software per Evaluation License. The Software is "in-use" on a computer when it is loaded into temporary memory (i.e., RAM) or installed into the storage device of that computer.
You may make a single copy of the Software for backup purposes only.
Old license(s) will be revoked within 60 days after a license upgrade.
Dynamsoft reserves the right to change these terms and conditions at any time without prior notice.
