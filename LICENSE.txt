1. DEFINITIONS
"Application" means an end user program that the Licensee develops using the Software and into which the Redistributables are incorporated, and which contain significant additional functionality over and above the functionality contained in the Software. Read what is counted as a single application to learn more.
"Client Device" means: (i) a desktop computer (Windows, macOS or Linux) that runs Dynamic Web TWAIN Service, or (ii) a browser client of a mobile device that accesses the Software.
"Licensee" means the person or entity entering into this Agreement with Dynamsoft. Any person who is entering into this Agreement on behalf of an organizational entity represents that he or she has the authority to bind such entity.
"Redistributables" are those runtime libraries and files intended for duplication and distribution with the Application.
"Server" means a device or computer that has the Software loaded into its RAM. Server includes the following: (i) a networked device with the Software installed that's accessible by multiple users who can independently operate the Software from another machine, (ii) a networked device with the Software running as a service that accepts connections from other machines or applications, (iii) a computer with the Software running to service the public or multiple users, e.g. a kiosk or a scan station, and (iv) a web server with the Software deployed that accepts end user connection to run the Software on the client machines.
"Software": The "Dynamic Web TWAIN" software and its add-ons, accompanying components, parts and documentation that have been developed by Dynamsoft. If you are using Dynamic Web TWAIN along with Dynamsoft OCR Professional add-on, the Dynamsoft OCR Professional EULA will apply at the same time. 
2.GRANT OF LICENSE 
Dynamsoft Corporation grants you a nonexclusive, non-transferable, and limited license to use the Software products and functionalities for which you have paid the applicable fees solely for your internal business purposes and in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. The Software is licensed, not sold, to you. If you acquire or are provided with any directories, components, connectors, utilities, data, or other items from Dynamsoft for use with the Software (the "Additional Software"), your use of the Additional Software shall be in accordance with the terms, conditions, obligations and restrictions of this Agreement. The term "Software" as used herein, shall be deemed to include the Additional Software and Third-Party Products.
2.1 Installation and Use
You may install and use the Software only in the configuration and for the number of licenses acquired by you. In order to exercise your rights to the Software under this License Agreement you must activate your copy of the Software in the manner described during the launch sequence. Dynamsoft may control the number and type of licenses and the use of the Software by keycode(s).
2.2 Evaluation License
An Evaluation License may be used only for quantity, type of licenses specified and for the period specified on the Software packaging, ordering or shipping documentation. Upon expiration of such specified period, the Software associated with an Evaluation License will cease to function unless Licensee has purchased full license keys. If the ordering or shipping documentation specifies a particular project, the Software may be used only with that project.  
An Evaluation License may only be used for evaluation or testing purposes and may not be used for production purposes. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Software provided under an Evaluation License is provided "AS-IS" without warranty of any kind, express or implied. An Evaluation License may be terminated by Dynamsoft Corporation upon written notice at any time.
2.3 Deployment License	
A Deployment License allows copying, deployment, and distribution of the Redistributables to end users, without further distribution, as part of the Application for your internal business purposes, not for resale to external customers. 
Unless otherwise stated in a duly executed agreement, annual subscription licenses will be valid for one year beginning with the license activation date. Licensee can extend licenses for additional one-year periods (each a "Renewal Term").
The Deployment Licenses is on a per Application basis with the following licensing options available:
•	2.3.1 Per Client Device License
One Client Device License allows access to a same-origin Application (same protocol, same host, and same port) to use the functionalities provided by the Software from one unique Client Device. 
A Client Device that has not accessed any functionality of the Software for a consecutive 90-day period is considered an inactive Client Device. The license seat taken by an inactive Client Device will be automatically released and available for use by any other active Client Device.
When you reach the limit of the granted number of license seats, Dynamsoft offers a free additional 10% of your client device allowance for your emergency use. Once running out of the additional client device allowance, no new client devices can access and use the Software until there are available license seats again. Please note that running out of your client device allowance wouldn't impact any client device that has already been licensed.
•	2.3.2 Per Server License
One Server License is required to deploy the Application to one Server. Servers apply to both physical and virtual servers and include but are not limited to production servers all of which require licensing: failover servers, development servers that are also used for testing purposes, quality assurance servers, testing servers, and staging servers. Continuous integration servers (build servers) and localhost development servers don't require additional licenses. 
Per-server license is only for on-premises server deployment and is not applicable for cloud deployments. Please refer to section 2.4 below for applicable licensing if you are providing a cloud hosted/service application.
•	2.3.3 Per Page License
With a Per Page License, the Software can be used for processing a given number of document pages. For example, with a license for 100K pages of the scanner module of the Software, you can scan up to 100K document pages and save them to your server. 
Please contact sales@dynamsoft.com if you are interested in the Per Page License option.
2.4 OEM, ASP/Service Bureau and other Deployment Licenses 
Licensee must execute a separate agreement prior to making any commercial deployment of the Application to third-party end users, either directly or through distribution channels. This may happen when Licensee acts as an ISV, OEM, ASP/service bureau, or solution provider offering the Application to the public.
Applicable and additional licensing options can be discussed with sales@dynamsoft.com.
